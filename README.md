# HGP-SL
Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning (paper available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05954)).
<br>
This is a PyTorch reimplementation of the HGP-SL model mentioned above. 

The required libraries can be installed via pip using the command: <br>
pip install -r requirements.txt

To Run: <br>
Press "run all" in the jupyter notebook (main_jup.ipynb). <br>
(There is no need to download any datasets as they are imported from torch_geometric.)
